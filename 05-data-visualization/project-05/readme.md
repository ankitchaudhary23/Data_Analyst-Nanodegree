## Dataset

The data consist of approximately 2.38M bike rides from FY2017-2018. The attributes include the trip start/end time, start/end station, duration in seconds as well as additional information such as user type, gender, and birth date. 155K data points were removed from the analysis due to inconsistencies in the birth date, which in some cases was dated prior 1900. The data can be found [here](https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels/system-data), with feature documentation available [here](https://www.fordgobike.com/system-data).

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on the influence of age, timeframe, weekday, age group of bike hiring data. I start by introducing the age distrubition, monthly bike hiring trend, followed by age group distribution, then plot the weekday, timeframe with age data. I tried to use different color palettes for each variables to make sure it is clear and to ber interested that they're different between each other.
